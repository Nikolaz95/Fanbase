core – primitives, low level components

shared – components that are shared across the whole app


features – root folder for components based on a specific feature (could be scoped by page or island)

contexts
The contexts folder stores all your React context files that used to share states between components each other. There are large projects you will have multiple context you use across your application. If you are using a different state manage such as Redux, you can replace this folder for share states.

Layouts Folder Mapa rasporeda
As the name says, it contains layouts available to the whole project like header, footer, etc. We can store the header, footer, or sidebar code here and call it.

Assets Folder Mapa imovine
As the name says, it contains assets of our project. It consists of images and styling files. Here we can store our global styles. We are centralizing the project so we can store the page-based or component-based styles over here. But we can even keep style according to the pages folder or component folder also. But that depends on developer comfortability.


Components Folder
Components are the building blocks of any react project. This folder consists of a collection of UI components like buttons, modals, inputs, loader, etc., that can be used across various files in the project. Each component should consist of a test file to do a unit test as it will be widely used in the project.

Pages Folder
The files in the pages folder indicate the route of the react application. Each file in this folder contains its route. A page can contain its sub folder. Each page has its state and is usually used to call an sync operation. It usually consists of various components grouped.

Middle ware Folder
This folder consists of middle ware that allows for side effects in the application. It is used when we are using reduce with it. Here we keep all our custom middle ware.

Routes Folder
This folder consists of all routes of the application. It consists of private, protected, and all types of routes. Here we can even call our sub-route.

Config Folder
This folder consists of a configuration file where we store environment variables in config.js. We will use this file to set up multi-environment configurations in your application.

Utils Folder
Utils folder consists of some repeatedly used functions that are commonly used in the project. It should contain only common js functions & objects like dropdown options, regex condition, data formatting, etc.
